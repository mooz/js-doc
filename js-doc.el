;;; Commentary:

;; Installation:
;; put `js-doc.el' somewhere in your emacs load path
;; add a line below to your .emacs file
;; (require 'js-doc)

;; Example:
;; paste the codes below into your .emacs.el file and you can
;;
;; 1. insert function document by pressing Ctrl + c, i
;; 2. insert @tag easily by pressing @ in the JsDoc style comment
;;
;; (setq js-doc-mail-address "your email address"
;;       js-doc-author (format "your name <%s>" js-doc-mail-address)
;;       js-doc-url "url of your website"
;;       js-doc-license "license name")
;;
;; (add-hook 'js2-mode-hook
;;           #'(lambda ()
;;               (define-key js2-mode-map "\C-ci" 'js-doc-insert-function-doc)
;;               (define-key js2-mode-map "@" 'js-doc-insert-tag)))
;;
;; If you want to see the tag description, just input the next command
;;   M-x js-doc-describe-tag
